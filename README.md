# DoDAF_Training

 This is just an initial introduction to the DoD's Architectual Framework. It is intended for early architects and engineers. It is not exact instructions for following the framework and diverges slightly but intended to be useful for documentation. Eventually I will write up a longer form post about this but for now, this will do.
